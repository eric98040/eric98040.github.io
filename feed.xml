I will continue to update the book list and comments as I progress through my research journey.</em></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>As an undergraduate researcher aiming to dive deep into <strong>Generative Models</strong>, <strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong>, and <strong>Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)</strong>, I recently faced a critical turning point in my career.</p> <p>In the early days of my research, I found myself merely skimming through the equations in papers. I would often blindly accept the authors’ claims, implementing their models without truly understanding the theoretical guarantees behind them. I realized I lacked the <strong>“critical eye”</strong> necessary to judge whether a methodology was rigorously sound or if the experiments logically supported the arguments.</p> <p>To transition from a practitioner who simply “uses” models to a researcher who <strong>constructs novel logical frameworks</strong> and <strong>proposes original algorithms</strong>, relying on intuition and code snippets was not enough. I needed a tool to rigorously validate existing ideas and build my own.</p> <p>While code brings these models to life, their <strong>theoretical foundations are deeply rooted in Mathematics.</strong></p> <p>This post outlines the mathematical roadmap I have constructed to build that foundation. The resources listed below are those I have personally studied or am currently studying to acquire the logical strength required for a Ph.D. and beyond.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="part-1-the-non-negotiable-essentials-️">Part 1: The Non-Negotiable Essentials 🏗️</h2> <p>The following three areas (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics) are the absolute prerequisites for <strong>any</strong> field of AI. Without these, it is impossible to deeply understand the mechanics of model training and inference.</p> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="1-calculus-">1. Calculus 📉</h3> <p>Many assume Calculus in AI is just about calculating gradients for backpropagation. However, its role is far more profound. <strong>Calculus is the language of continuous change.</strong></p> <p>To conduct research in <strong>Generative Models</strong> or <strong>Physics-Informed ML</strong>, you must understand how functions approximate reality and how distributions transform.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Modeling Dynamics:</strong> Neural ODEs and Diffusion Models treat depth/time as a continuous variable, requiring a solid grasp of differential equations.</li> <li><strong>Change of Variables:</strong> In Normalizing Flows, understanding the Jacobian Determinant is essential to track how probability density changes during transformation.</li> <li><strong>Approximation:</strong> Taylor Series are not just for exams; they explain how local approximations allow neural networks to learn complex non-linear functions.</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="-recommended-books">📚 Recommended Books</h4> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Calculus (James Stewart)</code></strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why this book:</strong> This is the standard bible for undergraduate calculus. I used this to solidify my understanding of the basics: limits, derivatives, and integrals. It is crucial for ensuring there are no holes in your fundamental calculation skills before moving to vector spaces.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-James-Stewart/dp/1285740629">👉 Link to Book</a></p> </blockquote> <p><br/></p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vector Calculus (J. Marsden &amp; A. Tromba)</code></strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why this book:</strong> Neural networks operate in high-dimensional vector spaces. This book provides the rigor needed to understand gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). It is essential for understanding how concepts like the “Chain Rule” expand into matrix-vector products in deep architectures.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Calculus-Jerrold-E-Marsden/dp/1429215089">👉 Link to Book</a></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h3 id="2-linear-algebra-">2. Linear Algebra 📐</h3> <p>If Calculus describes how things change, <strong>Linear Algebra describes the structure they live in.</strong> It is the “Container” and “Tool” for every piece of data we handle.</p> <p>Every weight, bias, and latent vector in Deep Learning is represented as a tensor. Concepts like <strong>Rank</strong>, <strong>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)</strong>, and <strong>Eigendecomposition</strong> are not just abstract theorems; they are practical tools for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Understanding which directions in data space contain the most information (PCA).</li> <li><strong>Model Compression:</strong> Low-rank approximation techniques to reduce model size.</li> <li><strong>Stability Analysis:</strong> Analyzing eigenvalues to prevent exploding gradients in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</li> </ul> <p><em>(Note on Book Choice: While pure mathematics texts like <strong>Friedberg</strong> or <strong>Hoffman &amp; Kunze</strong> are excellent for abstract rigor, my research focuses on application and system design. Therefore, I chose books that prioritize <strong>Geometric Intuition</strong> and <strong>System-Theoretic</strong> views, which I find sufficient and more practical for AI research.)</em></p> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="-recommended-books-1">📚 Recommended Books</h4> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Introduction to Linear Algebra (Gilbert Strang)</code></strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why this book:</strong> Professor Strang is the master of intuition. Instead of getting lost in abstract proofs, I studied this book to visualize the “Four Fundamental Subspaces.” It transforms Linear Algebra from a set of dry matrix operations into a geometric tool for understanding how data is projected and transformed.</p> <p><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">👉 Link to Book</a></p> </blockquote> <p><br/></p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Linear System Theory and Design (Chi-Tsong Chen)</code></strong> <em>(Chapters 2-6)</em></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why this book:</strong> While Strang gives intuition, Chen provides the framework for <strong>Dynamic Systems</strong>. Chapters 2 through 6 are vital for understanding <strong>State-Space Models (SSMs)</strong> and <strong>Control Theory</strong>. This system-theoretic perspective is increasingly important in modern Deep Learning (e.g., Mamba, Linear Recurrent Units) and Reinforcement Learning.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linear-System-Theory-Design-Chi-Tsong/dp/0199959579">👉 Link to Book</a></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h3 id="3-mathematical-statistics-">3. Mathematical Statistics 📊</h3> <p>Deep Learning is often mistaken for just “fitting curves” or “function approximation.” In reality, it is <strong>Statistical Inference at Scale.</strong></p> <p>To conduct serious research, you must stop viewing Loss Functions as arbitrary formulas and start seeing them as statistical estimators.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Loss Functions are Estimators:</strong> Understanding <strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)</strong> reveals that minimizing Cross-Entropy Loss is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the data.</li> <li><strong>Regularization is Bayesian Inference:</strong> “Weight Decay” isn’t just a hack to prevent overfitting; it is <strong>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)</strong> estimation with a Gaussian Prior on the weights.</li> <li><strong>Generative Modeling:</strong> In VAEs and Diffusion Models, we are not just generating pixels; we are explicitly modeling and sampling from complex, high-dimensional <strong>Probability Distributions</strong>. You need to be comfortable with concepts like the Change of Variables formula and Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence.</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="-recommended-books-2">📚 Recommended Books</h4> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mathematical Statistics with Applications (John E.

It avoids overwhelming the reader with excessive formality right from the start, making it ideal for beginners.</li> <li>It strikes a great balance between theory and application, with a sufficient number of exercises to test your intuition.
