Welcome! :wave: I am an undergraduate student in Semiconductor Engineering at Korea University and an undergraduate researcher at the [`Complex Data Analytics Lab (CDAL)`](https://sites.google.com/view/ku-cdal), advised by Prof. Junhee Seok.

My research interests center on advancing machine learning methods that combine mathematical rigor with practical applicability. I am particularly interested in how the principles of probability, differential equations, and physics can inform the design of more robust and efficient learning algorithms. In particular, I focus on areas such as generative models, stochastic partial differential equations, deep reinforcement learning, and physics-informed machine learning.

I believe that blending these directions provides a pathway toward models that are not only powerful but also grounded in mathematic principles.

You can find more details about my academic background and experiences in my [`Curriculum Vitae (CV)`](/assets/pdf/CV_Jaewon_Kim.pdf).
