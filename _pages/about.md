**Research:** I am an undergraduate student in Semiconductor Engineering at Korea University. My research interests span generative models, reinforcement learning, and their applications in 3D space. At [Complex Data Analytics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ku-cdal) (CDAL), under Prof. Seok Junhee's guidance, I work on developing novel approaches using `probabilistic generative models` and `reinforcement learning algorithms`. My current research focuses on diffusion models, GANs, advanced RL algorithms (PPO, SAC), and their integration with neural rendering and 3D reconstruction. Recent projects include DiffOptics (diffusion-based optical design generation) and OpticalGAN (conditional generation with precise control parameters).

In the realm of generative models, I'm particularly interested in exploring novel architectures that can handle complex 3D structures and multi-modal data. My work with diffusion models focuses on developing more efficient sampling strategies and improving the quality of generated samples through better noise scheduling and architectural innovations. In reinforcement learning, I'm investigating ways to combine model-based and model-free approaches for better sample efficiency and generalization.

A significant part of my research involves integrating these different approaches - using generative models to create better environmental models for RL agents, and employing RL to optimize the generation process in diffusion models. I'm also exploring the potential of graph neural networks as a powerful tool for representing and learning complex relationships in both generative and reinforcement learning contexts.

Through my work at CDAL, I aim to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of generative AI and reinforcement learning. Beyond technical implementation, I'm deeply interested in the mathematical foundations that underpin these models, particularly in optimization theory and probabilistic modeling. I maintain a [tech blog](https://www.jaewon.work) where I share insights about deep learning, generative models, and reinforcement learning algorithms.
