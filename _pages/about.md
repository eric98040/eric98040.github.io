Welcome! :wave: I am an undergraduate student in Semiconductor Engineering at Korea University and a researcher at [Complex Data Analytics Lab (CDAL)](https://sites.google.com/view/ku-cdal) under the guidance of Prof. Junhee Seok.  

What excites me most about AI research is diving deep into the `mathematical foundations` that make these systems work. Rather than just implementing existing solutions, I love breaking down complex problems into their basic components and building them back up – it's like solving a puzzle where each piece has its own mathematical beauty.

My research focuses on improving the efficiency of generative models and reinforcement learning while exploring `Physical AI`—a field that integrates principles of physics with AI systems to enhance model design, optimization, and real-world applicability. Physical AI involves applying physical laws and constraints to inform AI model development, making the models more robust and interpretable in practical scenarios.

I share insights and technical breakdowns of deep learning and AI concepts on my [tech blog](https://www.jaewon.work/blog). If you are interested in research that blends deep learning, efficient algorithms, and the physics-inspired side of AI, let's connect.

**Research Interests**  
* **Generative Models:** Diffusion models, GANs, with emphasis on precise control and optimization  
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Both model-based and model-free approaches, sample efficiency  
* **Physical AI:** Integrating physical principles in AI systems for enhanced real-world problem solving
