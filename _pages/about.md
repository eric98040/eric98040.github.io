Welcome! I am an undergraduate student in Semiconductor Engineering at Korea University, working as a researcher at [Complex Data Analytics Lab (CDAL)](https://sites.google.com/view/ku-cdal) under Prof. Junhee Seok's guidance. My research focuses on `generative models`, `reinforcement learning`, and their applications in `3D space`. I'm particularly interested in developing novel approaches that integrate diffusion models and advanced RL algorithms with neural rendering and 3D reconstruction.

My current work explores ways to combine `model-based` and `model-free` approaches in RL for better sample efficiency, while also investigating efficient sampling strategies for diffusion models. I'm especially interested in the intersection of these areas - using generative models to create better environmental models for RL agents, and employing RL to optimize generation processes. Recent projects include `DiffOptics` (diffusion-based optical design generation) and `OpticalGAN` (conditional generation with precise control parameters).

Beyond research, I maintain a [tech blog](https://www.jaewon.work/blog) where I share insights about AI and Deep Learning. I'm always eager to collaborate on projects involving deep learning, generative models, or reinforcement learning algorithms.
