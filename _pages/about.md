**Research:** I am passionate about developing AI-driven approaches for semiconductor engineering, with a focus on generative models and their applications in 3D space. At Complex Data Analytics Lab (CDAL), under Prof. Seok Junhee's guidance, I work on simulator acceleration and inverse design of semiconductor devices using probabilistic generative models. My research interests span generative models (Diffusion, GANs), 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, and the integration of physics-based simulation with deep learning. Recent projects include DiffOptics (diffusion-based optical design generation) and OpticalGAN (power-wavelength conditional generation of photonic devices).

I'm a Semiconductor Engineering student at Korea University, where I explore the intersection of advanced semiconductor technology and artificial intelligence. My goal is to push the boundaries of semiconductor design and optimization through innovative AI applications. Beyond academics, I actively participate in research projects and maintain a [tech blog](https://www.jaewon.work) where I share insights about AI and semiconductor technology.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
