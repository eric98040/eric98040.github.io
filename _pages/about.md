Welcome to my website! I am an undergraduate student in Semiconductor Engineering at Korea University, working as a researcher at [Complex Data Analytics Lab (CDAL)](https://sites.google.com/view/ku-cdal) under Prof. Junhee Seok's guidance.

My current work explores ways to combine model-based and model-free approaches in RL for better sample efficiency, while also investigating efficient sampling strategies for diffusion models. Recent projects include `DiffOptics` (diffusion-based optical design generation) and `OpticalGAN` (conditional generation with precise control parameters).

Beyond research, I maintain a [tech blog](https://www.jaewon.work/blog) where I share insights about AI and Deep Learning. I'm always eager to collaborate on projects involving deep learning, generative models, or reinforcement learning algorithms.

**Research Interests:**
* **Generative Models**: Diffusion models, GANs, with focus on precise control and optimization
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Model-based and model-free approaches, sample efficiency
* **3D Vision & Rendering**: Neural rendering, 3D reconstruction, environmental modeling
* **Deep Learning**: Advanced optimization techniques, efficient sampling strategies
* **Applications**: Optical design generation, 3D space modeling, computer vision
