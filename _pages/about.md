Welcome! :wave: I am an undergraduate student in Semiconductor Engineering at Korea University, working as a researcher at [Complex Data Analytics Lab (CDAL)](https://sites.google.com/view/ku-cdal) under Prof. Junhee Seok's guidance.

What excites me most about AI research is diving deep into the `mathematical foundations` that make these systems work. Rather than just implementing existing solutions, I love breaking down complex problems into their basic components and building them back up â€“ it's like solving a puzzle where each piece has its own mathematical beauty.

Right now, my work focuses on making `generative models` and `reinforcement learning` more efficient by really understanding what's happening under the hood. This approach has led to some exciting projects: `DiffOptics`, where we're using diffusion models to generate optical designs, and `OpticalGAN`, which lets us precisely control the generation process.

I share my thoughts and findings about AI and Deep Learning on my [tech blog](https://www.jaewon.work/blog), where I try to break down complex concepts into their fundamental building blocks. If you're interested in collaborative research that combines deep learning with mathematical precision, I'd love to hear from you!

**`Research Interests:`**
* **Generative Models**: Diffusion models, GANs, with focus on precise control and optimization
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Model-based and model-free approaches, sample efficiency
* **3D Vision & Rendering**: Neural rendering, 3D reconstruction, environmental modeling
* **Deep Learning**: Advanced optimization techniques, efficient sampling strategies
* **Applications**: Optical design generation, 3D space modeling, computer vision
